# Mobile-range-Prediction-using-Random-Forest
This project aims to predict the price range of mobile phones based on their specifications using a Random Forest classifier. The dataset, publicly available, includes features such as battery power, Bluetooth connectivity, clock speed, and more. The project involves several key steps: data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, tuning, and deployment.

Data preprocessing ensures the dataset is clean, while feature engineering selects the most relevant features for prediction. The Random Forest model is trained on this refined dataset and evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. A confusion matrix is also generated to visualize model performance.

Hyperparameter tuning is performed through cross-validation to optimize the model. The trained model is then used to predict the price range of a mobile phone based on its specifications. The project concludes with a discussion on deploying the model as a web application using frameworks like Flask or Streamlit.

The repository includes the Python script for the entire process, a saved model, and a detailed report in a Word document. This project demonstrates an effective approach to mobile price prediction using machine learning.
