# Mobile-range-Prediction-using-Random-Forest
The Mobile Price Range Prediction app uses a Random Forest model to estimate a phone's price category. Users input specs like battery power, camera quality, and memory. The app then predicts the price range, making it easy for consumers and retailers to assess mobile phones based on their features.
