# Mobile-range-Prediction-using-Random-Forest
This project aims to predict the price range of mobile phones based on their specifications using a Random Forest classifier. The dataset, publicly available, includes features such as battery power, Bluetooth connectivity, clock speed, and more. The project involves several key steps: data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, tuning, and deployment.

Data preprocessing ensures the dataset is clean, while feature engineering selects the most relevant features for prediction. The Random Forest model is trained on this refined dataset and evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. A confusion matrix is also generated to visualize model performance.

Hyperparameter tuning is performed through cross-validation to optimize the model. The trained model is then used to predict the price range of a mobile phone based on its specifications. The project concludes with a discussion on deploying the model as a web application using frameworks like Flask or Streamlit.

The repository includes the Python script for the entire process, a saved model, and a detailed report in a Word document. This project demonstrates an effective approach to mobile price prediction using machine learning.

# Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning is a crucial step in optimizing the performance of a machine 
learning model. It involves adjusting the parameters that govern the training process to 
find the optimal set of values that yield the best model performance.
Importance of Hyperparameter Tuning:
Enhances Model Accuracy: Proper tuning can significantly improve the
 modelâ€™s accuracy and predictive power.
Prevents Overfitting: By finding the right balance, hyperparameter tuning 
helps in preventing the model from overfitting to the training data.
Optimizes Performance: It ensures the model is both efficient and 
effective in its predictions.
Method Used: Custom Tuning with Random Forest
We implemented a custom hyperparameter tuning method for the Random Forest
classifier. The code iteratively tests different values for the max_depth parameter, which 
controls the maximum depth of each tree in the forest.
Process:
Parameter Initialization: We initialized the Random Forest classifier 
with a fixed random state to ensure reproducibility.
Train-Test Split: The data was split into training and testing sets with a  test size of 
23%.
Iterative Training and Evaluation: For each value of max_depth from 1 to 30,the model
 was trained and evaluated using precision, accuracy, training score, and  testing score.
Result Collection: The performance metrics for each max_depth value were collected 
and  analyzed.
